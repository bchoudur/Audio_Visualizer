This is audio visualizer I created for fun.
NOTE: Must be run on Edge. Unless you are running it though the link then it should work but if you download it, then it must be run though Edge. I really can't figure out why this is but at least on my computer it works that way.
Simply copy and paste the line of code in your browser url to run
